43RésumésWe judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing,while others judge us by what we have already done.—HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOWA résumé gives prospective employers a written summary of your qualifications and work history. It convinces the reader that you’re a good candidate for the position and that you should be invited for an interview.Although it lacks most of the features of a sales letter (few employers are dazzled by extravagant claims and catchy language), the résumé is a letter in which you are both the seller and the product.When applying for a job, you might use one or two of the following:résumé, a businesslike summary of your work history, education, and career goals;cover letter, a brief letter written to accompany a résumé;letter of application, a combination cover letter and brief, informal résumé.See COVER LETTERS and APPLICATIONS for assistance with the second two.Send a Résumé When• applying for a franchise• applying for a job or internship• applying for membership in certain organizations• applying to universities/degree programs• inquiring about openings at a company• responding to an employment adHow to Say It• Place your name, address, and daytime telephone number (and possibly e-mail address, fax number, and website address) at the top right or at the top center of your résumé (the top left position may get stapled or punched).• State the position or kind of job you’re seeking.• Detail your work experience and job skills. There are two basic approaches.340HOW TO SAY IT® / 3411. The traditional reverse chronological employment format starts by listing your most recent position and going back through time.This is the easiest format to use, but it has its weaknesses if there are gaps in your job history, if you’re new to the job market, or if your previous jobs don’t seem to relate well to the one you are seeking.The emphasis in this listing is on concrete information: dates of employment, name and full address of employer, job title, job duties, reason for leaving, if appropriate.2. The non-chronological résumé (also called a skills-oriented or functional résumé) stresses your qualifications and abilities. You group job experiences according to a specific skill. For example, under“Leadership Skills” you write, “Supervised night shift at Hooper & Co. for two years.” Under “Interpersonal Skills” write, “As the mayor’s troubleshooter, I was often called upon to intervene in disputes, negotiate contracts, and otherwise deal with constituents, politicians, and city personnel under difficult circumstances.” “Organizational Skills” might include: “I was hired at Arnold-Browne to reorganize the accounting department, which was barely functioning at the time due to staff turnover, low morale, lack of department guidelines, and poor use of office space. At the end of two years, I was commended by the company president for ‘unparalleled organizing skills.’”You can also combine the two approaches; under each job listed in reverse chronological order, group skills used in that position. Or, slant your résumé directly toward the job under consideration by listing the general qualifications and specific qualifications you have for it.• Give the essential facts of your education: name of school, city and state where it is located, years you attended, the diploma or certificate you earned, the course of studies you pursued, special training, significant honors or memberships.• List publications, if appropriate.What Not to Say• Don’t include a photograph or personal information (age or birth year, weight, height, marital or financial status, children, ethnicity, disability, religious or political affiliation) unless it is pertinent to the situation you are seeking. For example, to apply for a position as a weight control group leader, a mention of your weight history is probably indicated. It is often illegal for prospective employers to ask questions about age, sex, race, and religion.• Don’t tell what you expect the company to do for you. (“This position is a wonderful opportunity to learn about the marketing side of the342 / HOW TO SAY IT®automotive industry.”) Emphasize instead what you can contribute to the company.• Don’t present your accomplishments so that they say, “Here is what I’ve done.” Instead, phrase them to say, “Here is what I can do for you.” For example, “I have the experience and ability to help you increase production efficiency. While I was supervisor at Fortis & Co., department overruns decreased 32%.”• Don’t tell every single thing you’ve done. Filler material detracts from a strong résumé. People who throw in all the extras on the theory that it “can’t hurt” may be wrong. Don’t include information on childhood, early schooling, hobbies, or interests (unless they relate directly to the position). Omit work you’ve done in the past that you don’t want to do again, unless this would leave unexplained holes in your résumé.• Don’t embellish, exaggerate, tell half-truths, or, of course, lie. Many companies have résumé fact-checkers and if you’re found out, you will be dismissed, will suffer embarrassment and humiliation, and may be liable for civil charges. Trying to make yourself sound better than you are is often a tip-off that you may not be well qualified for that particular position—or happy in it.• Don’t be too modest either by playing down your accomplishments.Have someone who knows you evaluate your final draft.• Don’t use “etc.” It is uninformative and irritating and conveys excessive casualness.• Don’t use weak adjectives and adverbs. Remove every “very” you find and such lukewarm words as “good,” “wonderful,” “exciting.”Use instead strong, perhaps even unusual, nouns and verbs. See lists of adjectives, nouns, and verbs in this chapter.• Don’t use jargon, long, involved phrases, a bookish vocabulary you don’t normally use, or acronyms (unless the acronym is so familiar in your field that it would be insulting to spell it out).• Don’t mention salary in a résumé; this is better discussed in an interview (and then try to get your interviewer to mention a figure before you do).Tips on Writing• Before writing a résumé, assemble two kinds of information: facts about yourself and facts about your prospective employer and the position. Call the company to ask questions. Research the company at the library. Speak to people who work there or who know the company. When you tell a prospective employer what you can do for their company, the implication is that you’ve studied the company enough to know where you might fit in; this is appealing. Although you cannot change the facts of your employment history, you canHOW TO SAY IT® / 343emphasize certain skills and qualifications if you know that this is what the employer wants. The employer may want creativity, for example, and none of your previous jobs emphasized it. Check other areas of your life to see where you have shown creativity—art classes, hobby photography, teaching pottery. When prospective employers see a résumé that has obviously been written especially for them, they give it more than the sixty seconds that most résumés get. By presenting as clear a picture of yourself as you can in terms of the employer’s needs, you make it easy for them to determine quickly whether there is a match.• Your résumé may be skimmed by a human resources assistant, scanned into a computer, or screened by a recruiter. It must appeal to all three: short paragraphs and white space and good headings to catch the eye of the assistant; plenty of appropriate keywords (see below) for the computer; a logical and persuasive organization of material for the recruiter.• Large companies use Optical Character Readers (OCRs) to scan incoming résumés. Software identifies keywords and stores the résumés in a large database. When a new employee is needed, the database is searched by keywords to identify applicants who have the needed skills. Some career counselors recommended a special keyword section with a listing of terms that might get your résumé pulled.Others point out that the computer will find the terms whether they are in one paragraph or spread out through the résumé. What is critical is that your résumé contain the words most likely to identify you for the position you want. Tips for scanned résumés: put only your name on the first line as that’s what the software is expecting; use jargon, acronyms, and other words commonly used in your field, along with their logical synonyms; identify abilities specifically, for example, name the computer software you’re familiar with (don’t simply list“word-processing skills”); use variations of words (“administrator,”“administered”) so that the program will pick up either; be specific (“advertising manager” instead of “manager” so that no matter which is searched for, it’ll be caught; use only one date for your education (the date you received your degree) or the program will assume you simply spent time there; use both “R.N.” and “Registered Nurse” in case only one has been requested; check the advertisement you’re responding to and be certain the words used in it appear on your résumé.• Your résumé is only as long as it needs to be. Most authorities recommend no more than one or two pages. InThe Smart Job Search,Mark L. Makos says, “Unless it is not important to you to get a job, a one-page résumé is your only choice.” However, for many academic and professional positions, you may need more than two pages—as many as twelve perhaps, if you have a long list of publications, patents, cases, conference presentations, or other itemizations. Whether one page or twelve, your résumé must be tightly written and readable:344 / HOW TO SAY IT®use simple, short sentences, keep paragraphs short, and leave plenty of white space and ample margins. “Think of a résumé as a sixtysecond television commercial: that’s probably all the time the reader is going to spend on it.” (Lassor A. Blumenthal)• Sample headings and divisions (you will generally have no more than five or six) that might be useful to you in constructing your résumé include:ActivitiesAdditional AccomplishmentsAdditional ExperienceAwards, Honors, OfficesBackground SummaryCareer HighlightsCareer ObjectiveCareer SummaryCommunication SkillsCopywriting ExperienceEditorial ExperienceEducationEmployment ObjectiveExecutive ProfileExperienceExtracurricular ActivitiesHighlighted QualificationsInterpersonal SkillsJob ObjectiveKey QualificationsLeadership SkillsManagement ProfileManagerial ExperienceMembershipsNegotiating SkillsNew Product Development SkillsOffice Management SkillsOffice SkillsOrganizational and ManagerialOverview of QualificationsSkillsProfessional AchievementsProfessional AffiliationsProfessional BackgroundProfessional ExperienceProfessional HistoryProfessional ProfileProfessional QualificationsPromotional SkillsRelated ExperienceRelevant AccomplishmentsRelevant ExperienceRetail Sales ExperienceRésuméSkillsSkills SummarySpecial SkillsSummary of QualificationsSummary of Work HistorySupervisory SkillsSystems SkillsTechnical ExperienceTrainingVolunteer WorkWork Experience• Concentrate on your strengths; you don’t have to includeHOW TO SAY IT® / 345everything you’ve ever done. For each characteristic that you think your employer might want (leadership ability, problem solving, initiative), assemble examples from your work history.• There are three ways to refer to yourself in a résumé: (1) in the first person (“I managed the Midway Pro Bowl for three years, and saw it double in profits during that time”); (2) in the third person (“She has worked in a number of areas of radio broadcasting, including…”or “Dr. Patikar organized a new patient outcare service”); (3) without a pronoun (“Developed a new method of twinning steel”). Each style has advantages and disadvantages. The first can be wearying with all its “I”s (omit as many as possible), the second can appear remote and pretentious, and the third may seem abrupt. Use the style you feel most comfortable with, regardless of what you perceive as its benefits or disadvantages. In any case, do not refer to yourself as “the writer”(“The writer has six years’ experience…”).• Use strong, active verbs. Instead of the weaker “I did this” or “I was responsible for that,” write “I managed,” “I developed,” “I directed.” See the list of active verbs in this chapter.• Make all listings parallel in form: “I directed…I supervised…I increased…” Not: “I directed…I was a supervisor…I have increased.”• You will use two tenses in a résumé: the present tense for categories like career goal (“Desire position with…”) and skills (“I am fluent in French, Italian, Spanish, and German”); the past tense for categories like work experience (“Headed all major advertising campaigns…”) and professional accomplishments (“I won a six-state cabinetmaking competition”).• Use numbers to report successful outcomes of your work. Even if you were only partly responsible for increasing sales, decreasing expenditures, or coming in under budget for the first time in ten years, mention the figures. State how many people you supervised, how many copies of your books were sold, how many projects you oversaw, how much time or money you saved the company, the size of the budget you were responsible for, the percentage reduction in absenteeism in your department, the percentage increase in productivity at your station. Figures are persuasive.• Resilience is an important qualification in a world where information and technology develop at high speeds. Emphasize your flexibility and ability to learn new tasks and adapt to new situations by making your past jobs sound different from each other. For example, if you’ve held several positions as an executive assistant, list under one position that you reorganized the filing system, under another that you trained employees in the use of the new telephone system, under yet another that you managed the office for three months while your supervisor was taking a leave of absence.• Use only years, not months, when dating your work history.• You need not mention the reason for leaving a position; if the346 / HOW TO SAY IT®employer wants to know, this will be brought up in the interview.Readily accepted reasons include: moving, returning to school, seeking a better position, unforeseen changes in your former job.• The old résumé standby, “References available upon request,”isn’t necessary since it is taken for granted that later in the process references will be requested by them and supplied by you. Include the line only if you need to fill white space at the end of your résumé.Always ask people in advance if you can use them as references.• Don’t use the same boilerplate résumé for each job you apply for.Each résumé should be tailored to the particular company and typed or printed freshly (no photocopies).• After you proofread your final draft, have at least two other people read it for you. The error that two of you miss will jump out at your prospective employer.• Don’t staple, glue, or seal your résumé into a binder or folder (unless requested to). The pages should be loose and paperclipped together; they are easier to handle. Mail your résumé and cover letter in a 9” x 12” envelope so they arrive unfolded and crisp-looking.• In some situations include work samples, publications, or other supplementary materials.• Check your library or bookstore for books devoted solely to résumé writing. Two suggestions: David F. Noble,Gallery of Best Résumés: ACollection of Quality Résumés by Professional Résumé Writers; Wendy S.Enelow, Résumé Winners From the Pros(includes names and addresses of professional résumé writers).Special Situations• If you prefer that your present employer doesn’t know you’re job-hunting, refer inquiries to your home phone or address and ask that references from your present employer wait until you and the prospective employer feel sure of the match.• When given an application form to fill out for a job, you may attach a résumé to it.• First-time job seekers encounter the classic frustration: They won’t hire me because I don’t have experience, and I don’t have experience because they won’t hire me. It is, however, possible to structure an appealing résumé without a significant work history. Summer jobs show dependability, initiative, responsibility. Extracurricular activities illustrate leadership potential, the ability to complete projects, and special interests. Awards, honors, GPA, elected offices, and scholarships indicate accomplishments and show that you have been singled out from your peers. Volunteer work, athletics, and organization memberships help define you and give you a profile. This type of résumé benefits from a skills orientation; you state that you are respons-HOW TO SAY IT® / 347ible, dependable, hardworking, a quick learner, or loyal and give illustrative examples.• When asked to furnish a brief biographical sketch (or bio) for program notes, a newspaper article, or a company newsletter, your résumé will help you write it. A bio is written in narrative fashion, is far briefer and less specific than a résumé, and aims to capture the essence rather than the details of who you are professionally.• When applying for a franchise, follow FTC guidelines. You may want a lawyer to help with some of the correspondence.• All résumés are typed, printed, or machine-produced on good bond paper (white or off-white), on one side only, in sharp black elite or pica type (no script or fancy font). They look professional, conservative, and straightforward. In a few fields, you might obtain a job using a highly creative résumé with graphics, colored inks, and an offbeat design. For this approach, however, you must understand your market—to the point perhaps of knowing someone at the company who obtained a job that way. This type of résumé receives admiring looks, but is often passed over for the more “stable”-looking résumé.• When your résumé will be scanned: use only white paper; don’t use graphic elements, small type, or unusual fonts (Times Roman or Ariel are good choices); don’t use italics, underlining, or boldface; use asterisks instead of bullets as they are read as periods. OCRs like reading boring, homogeneous résumés; use this style only for them.• Fax your résumé only if you have been asked to do so or someone needs it at once. Faxed résumés don’t look as good as those on résumé paper.• Résumés may be e-mailed in certain situations: the classified ad gives an e-mail address and asks that résumés be sent there; you find the job opening on the company website and they encourage sending your résumé by e-mail. Check with them first about any special e-mail requirements.WORDS (ACTIVE VERBS)acceleratedaccentuatedacceptedaccommodatedaccomplishedaccounted

Two years in the film industry as script supervisor, production coordinator, and short-film director were followed by graduate school; she will receive her MFA in film (directing) from Columbia University in 2001.Although Thompson admits her areas of specialization may seem unrelated to each other and a strange base on which to build a film career, she feels that anthropology, literally “the study of people,” uncovers truths about human behavior while both theater and film convey those truths viscerally. Her viewfinder might not look like a microscope and her notebook contains storyboards, not observations on Inuit rituals, but she strives to direct films that give viewers insight into different cultures as a means of better understanding their own ways and the broader human experience.A native of Minnesota, Thompson brought her interest in anthropology home with “The Windigo.” Set in the preserved wilderness of northern Minnesota, the story derives its title and subject from a local Ojibwe Indian myth and dramatizes the misunderstandings that can arise between cultures. Gerard strives to emulate native ways, but he embodies a recent trend that appropriates Indian legends and beliefs without truly understanding them. Sandy, on the other hand, learns the hard way that he is biased in favor of laboratory wisdom. “The Windigo” examines ancient myths through the eyes of contemporary culture in order to shed light on the past and the present.Regina Alving1939 Norway StreetCleveland, OH 44101216/555-1234OBJECTIVETo obtain a position as an administrative assistant commensurate with my experience, capabilities, and need to be challengedEDUCATION2-year degree from Engstrand Technical College in office administration, 1999358 / HOW TO SAY IT®WORK EXPERIENCEManders Realty, assistant to the president, 1996-present Oswald Engineering Consultants, Inc., administrative assistant, 1993-1996Ibsen Manufacturing International, assistant to the vice president, 1989-1993SKILLSAll general office dutiesTyping 65 wpmExtensive experience with Microsoft Word, Access, Excel, Oracle Data Base, PowerPoint, Peachtree AccountingGood oral and written communication skills Fluent in written and spoken SpanishPersonal characteristics include being highly organized, able to take a multi-task approach to the workday, self-motivated, tactful, discreet See also: APPLICATIONS, APPOINTMENTS, COVER LETTERS, EMPLOYMENT, FOLLOW-UP, REFERENCES, THANK YOU.
