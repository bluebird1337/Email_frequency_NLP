48Letters Related to TravelA trip is what you take when you can’t take any more of what you’ve been taking.—ADELINE AINSWORTHToday most travel arrangements (airline, car, hotel reservations; requests for tourist, passport, health information; cancellations) are made by phone, e-mail, or on the Internet. Occasionally, however, a letter or faxed letter is the best choice to outline complicated arrangements, confirm reservations, address special problems, or register a complaint.Every letter that a travel business writes to customers—even a one-sentence response to a query for information—is a sales or goodwill letter and is courteous, positive, and presentable.Write Travel Letters to• airlines• bus companies• campground/RV facilities• convention and visitors bureaus• cruise companies• customers of a travel business• employers for travel reimbursement• entertainment/amusement complexes• friends and relatives• hotels/motels/B&Bs• national parks• railroad companies• resorts/spas/dude ranches• tourist information centers• travel agentsHow to Say It• Begin with your question or item of business.407408 / HOW TO SAY IT®• Include specifics: dates; number of nights, people, rooms, type of accommodation, extras, verification of information about accessibility, pool, cable TV, entertaining facilities; type of car, number of days, pickup and dropoff points; record, confirmation, or other locator number; credit card number; your address and telephone number; names of guests or passengers.• Mention enclosed deposit or coupons.• Repeat terms or information you were given over the telephone.• Ask for a confirmation number.• Close with a courtesy.What Not to Say• Don’t volunteer unnecessary personal information.• Don’t put your credit card number in a letter unless you know the company well.• Don’t assume anything.
