8Letters of ApplicationThe nearest to perfection most people ever come is whenfilling out an employment application.—KEN KRAFTThere are three ways to persuade a prospective employer to invite you for an interview:1.Fill in one of the company’s application forms and submit it alone or with a cover letter (a brief letter stating that the application is enclosed and mentioning a point or two indicating you are a good candidate for the job).2.Send a résumé (a businesslike and detailed summary of your work and educational history, your skills, and your career goals), also accompanied by a cover letter.3.Write a letter of application, which is a combination cover letter and résumé—longer than a cover letter, shorter and less formal than a résumé. (The letter of application is also known as a broadcast letter or a letter of interest.)Which approach is best? The clue comes from the prospective employer: “Fill out an application form”; “Send or fax a résumé”; “Apply to the following department.”In addition to applications that are solicited (there is a definite opening being advertised), there are unsolicited applications (you know of no opening but you would like to work for that company). In the latter case, with no directions from the employer as to how to apply, a letter of application—a powerful one-page letter that includes résumé material—may be more effective than a conventional résumé and cover letter.Some organizations continue to rely on letters of application to gauge an applicant’s overall self-presentation and command of the written language.The purpose of the application letter is to attract and hold the reader’s attention long enough to get your letter placed in the short pile of those candidates who will receive an invitation to an interview. (The other pile is much, much taller.) A letter of application is thus a sales letter in which you are both seller and product.58HOW TO SAY IT® / 59Send an Application Letter to• camps• clubs and organizations• colleges, universities, technical schools• franchise companies• internships• private elementary and secondary schools• prospective employers• volunteer organizationsHow to Say It• Address your letter to a specific individual, after verifying the person’s title and double-checking the spelling of the name (even if it’s simple—“Gene” could be “Jeanne,” “John” could be “Jon”).• Open with an attention-getting sentence or paragraph.• Tell why you are seeking this position, why you have chosen to apply to this particular company, and why you believe you are qualified.• List the skills, education, and experience that are most relevant to the opening. Leave the rest for the interview.• Request an interview (“I will be in Burbank next week and would like to arrange an interview”).• Provide an address, daytime phone number, fax number, and e-mail address.• Close with a pleasant or forward-looking statement: “I appreciate your time and consideration”; “I look forward to discussing this position with you.”What Not to Say• Don’t indulge in generalities or the vague “etc.”; specify exactly what you can do or have done.• Don’t use gimmicks, fancy language that you don’t normally use, a“humorous” approach, or any attention-getting device that could backfire. Conservative (which is not the same as boring) is better here.• Don’t refer to yourself as “the writer” (“The writer has had six years’experience as a heavy equipment operator”).• Don’t emphasize how much the company can do to further your career goals. Emphasize rather how your abilities can benefit the company. Instead of the message “Here is what I can do,” fashion the message to say, “Here is what I can do for you.”• Don’t mention negative aspects of your present or past employment.• Don’t belittle your qualifications.60 / HOW TO SAY IT®• Don’t base your request on your need for the job or on an appeal to sympathy (“I am the only support of my family”); focus on what you have to offer.• Don’t mention salary in your letter (even when an ad asks you to state salary requirements); save that discussion for the interview.Tips on Writing• Don’t use your present company’s letterhead stationery for your letter of application.• Re-read your letter before mailing to see if it sounds confident, professional, and persuasive. If you were the employer, would you want to interview the person who wrote this?• Be concise. The letter of application should be no longer than one page.• Use action verbs when describing your abilities and accomplishments (see RÉSUMÉS for a list of effective verbs).• Tailor your message to a specific company. Employers can spot a generic or boilerplate letter; it tells them you are more interested in a job, any job, than in a job with them. Personalize your letter. When prospective employers receive a letter that has been written especially for them, they will give it more than the sixty seconds most letters get.• The most critical factor in getting an interview is how closely you match the prospective employer’s needs. You already know what you have to offer; you also have to know what the company needs from you. Call the company and ask questions; research the company at the library; speak to people who work there or who know the company.By presenting as clear a picture of yourself as you can, couched in terms of what the company needs, you make it easy for an employer to determine quickly whether there is a match.• It’s not necessary to say “References available upon request.” It is understood by both parties that references will be offered and checked.• Avoid spelling or grammar errors, low-quality paper, smudged or hard-to-read print, and poor spacing on the page. In the case of a fax, use the “fine resolution” setting to send as sharp a copy as possible.Special Situations• To apply for a franchise, study FTC guidelines. You may want a lawyer to help you with some of the correspondence.• Most applications to colleges, universities, community colleges, or technical schools are routine and codified. If, however, you are a student at the very high or very low end of your graduating class orHOW TO SAY IT® / 61if you have special needs (for financial assistance, for example), seek help from your high school counseling office, private counseling services, or some of the numerous publications available. For some students, the process of applying for admission to college can take many months and require specialized information.• If you are on the other side of the desk and are asked to design a job application form, familiarize yourself with state and federal anti-discrimination laws. You may not ask applicants for such information as age, race, sex, height and weight, color of eyes, hair, or complexion; birthplace; dates of public school attendance; arrest record, type of military discharge, past workers’ compensation claims; whether they own their own home, have ever been sued, or had a surety bond or government clearance denied; work transportation arrangements; non-job-related handicaps; activities, memberships, and hobbies not directly related to the job; how they heard about the job opening. Have a lawyer check the rough draft of your application form to ensure that it complies with state and federal laws.Format• Letters of application are typed, preferably on letterhead stationery.• Some prospective employers suggest that applicants fax materials to them. Unless a résumé is specifically requested, you may fax a letter of application, either with a cover sheet or leaving space at the top of the letter for the faxing information (see FAXES).WORDSabilitieseducationopportunityskillsapplyexperienceprofessionalsuitablebackgroundgoalsqualifiedcredentialsobjectivesresponsiblePHRASESapplying for the position ofmay I have fifteen minutesof yourarrange a meeting at yourtime to discussconveniencemeet and exceed your criteriaexperience that qualifies me forserious interest in62 / HOW TO SAY IT®extensive experience withsimilar to my mostrecent positiongood candidate/skills that would be useful tomatch for the jobin response to your advertisementten years’ experience withinterested in pursuing awell suited forcareer withSENTENCESAccording to this morning’s paper, you are seeking a storm restoration contractor.After eight years as a senior analog engineer at Blayds-Conway, I am seeking a position in this area because of a family move.At the suggestion of Wilhelmina Douglas-Stewart, I am writing to request an interview for the project leader position in your long haul fiber optic communications department.Because I believe you would find me to be an efficient, experienced, and dedicated legal administrative assistant, I am applying for the position at Wilson & Bean.Dr. Breuer has informed me that you are currently looking for a part-time veterinary technician.I am applying for the position of credit research analyst that you advertised in today’s paper.I look forward to hearing from you.I understand from Dr. Demetrius Doboobie that you have an opening for a medical records supervisor.I understand that there is currently no opening in your office, but I would like you to keep my résumé on file and to consider me for any openings that occur.I was happy to learn that there is an opening for an insurance underwriting coordinator at the Daffyd Evans Marine Insurance Agency.I was pleased to see your advertisement in this morning’s paper for a floral designer because I have just moved here and am looking for a position after having worked as a floral designer in Chicago for the past six years.I will call you Thursday to discuss setting up an interview.My eight years as a food microbiologist at Samuel Braceweight, Inc., make me eminently suitable for the responsibilities of the position you are currently advertising.HOW TO SAY IT® / 63Please consider me as an applicant for your advertised part-time position as clerical assistant in your business office.Roger Brevard told me that you are looking for a real-time software engineer.Thank you for considering my application.The skills and duties outlined in your advertisement in today’s paper are almost a perfect match for the position I held until recently at Geoffrey Bentley Publishers, Inc.PARAGRAPHSI have held a position as head teller very similar to the one you are currently advertising.
