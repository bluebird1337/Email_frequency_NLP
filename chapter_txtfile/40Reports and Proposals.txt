40Reports and ProposalsIt may be said of me by Harper & Brothers, that although Ireject their proposals, I welcome their advances.—EDNA ST. VINCENT MILLAYStandard proposals and reports aren’t letters, but shorter ones are sometimes written as letters or memos. They use plainer language, do not have heads, subheads, and clauses, and are less formal and less complicated.Proposals can be solicited (someone asks you for an estimate, bid, plan of action) or unsolicited (you want to sell your plan or service or program to someone who has not expressed a need for it). In either case, your proposal is a sales tool to persuade the other party that you are the best firm for the job (for a solicited proposal) or that it needs the service you are offering (for an unsolicited proposal).Report and Proposal Letters Include• acceptance of proposal/bid• acknowledgment of receipt (see ACKNOWLEDGMENTS)• bids and estimates• book and article proposals (see QUERIES)• compliance reports to government agencies• credit reports (see CREDIT)• investigative reports• management, staff, policy, or recommendation reports• progress/status reports• proposals: products/grants/projects/programs/sales/services• recommendations/suggestions• rejection of proposal/bid/report (see REFUSALS)• reports: annual/monthly/progress/management/staff/technical• responses to inquiries/requests• sales reports: weekly/monthly/annual314HOW TO SAY IT® / 315How to Say It• Begin with a reference line that identifies the subject of the proposal or report.• State why you are sending the report or proposal (“as requested,”“for your information,” “Charles O’Malley asked me to send you a copy,” “in response to your request for a quotation”).• Describe the report in one or two sentences.• The main body of the report or proposal—explaining the idea in detail, giving costs, specifications, deadlines, and examples of application—is organized into clear, logical units of information.• Summarize the report in one or two sentences.• Credit those who worked on the report or proposal.• Offer to provide additional information and give the name and telephone number of the contact person.• Tell what the next step is or what your expectations are (“call me,”“sign the enclosed contract,” “please respond with a written evaluation of the proposal”).• Thank the person for their time and consideration.What Not to Say• Don’t include other topics or business. The report or proposal is a focused document.• Don’t use jargon unless you’re sure it’s familiar to your readers.Tips on Writing• Before preparing a report or proposal, know the answers to these questions: Who will read the document? What is its purpose? What material will it cover? How will the material be presented?• The main body of a letter proposal or report can be as short as a paragraph or long enough to be divided into one or more of the traditional report elements: title page; summary, synopsis, or abstract; a foreword, preface, introduction, history or background; acknowledgments; table of contents; a presentation of data, options, conclusions, and recommendations; appendix, bibliography, endnotes, references, and notice of any attached supporting documents.• Before mailing the proposal or report, ask someone knowledgeable about the issues (in some cases a lawyer) to read it for clarity and precision. Double-check a proposal to be certain that every item in the original request has been responded to.• If timing is important to your report or proposal, send it return receipt requested so you can verify the date it was received.316 / HOW TO SAY IT®Special Situations• When writing grant proposals, three guidelines will boost your chances of success: (1) follow directions scrupulously—no allowances are made for deviations from stated formats; (2) present your material faultlessly—neatly typed on high-quality paper, error-free, well spaced; (3) the content must be your finest writing and slanted specifically to that funding organization—the identical material can seldom be proposed to two different groups. Artist resource groups offer help to grant applicants, and sometimes people in your field will critique your material.• Many progress reports have a codified format, but others may be written in narrative letter form. Include: what has been done during the reporting period; what is currently being done; what outstanding projects are waiting for attention; good news and bad news during the reporting period; other comments that give readers an appreciation of the progress of the student, employee, department, or company.• If it appears that your proposal will be acceptable to the other party, turn the proposal letter into a contract letter or binding agreement by adding at the bottom, “Read and approved on [date] by[signature and title].” If the proposal is part of a larger contract, add“pursuant to the Master Contract dated March 2, 2002, between Raikes Engineering and Phillips Contractors” (see also CONTRACTS).Format• Report or proposal letters are typewritten on letterhead or memo stationery.• When time is an issue, reports and proposals can be faxed or emailed, but send hard copies too.• Forms with blanks to be filled in are convenient for credit reports, school progress reports, routine production reports, and other reports that depend on numbers or short descriptions.WORDSabstractadviseagendaanalysisapplicationsappraiseapproachassesscalculatecomputeconcludeconditionsconsidercritiquedecisiondesigndiagramdisclosediscussiondisplaydraftestablishestimateevaluateHOW TO SAY IT® / 317exhibitexplanationexplorationexpositionfindingsforecastgaugeguesstimateinquiryinspectinstructionintroduceinvestigationissuejudgelayoutmethodmonographnotificationofferopinionoutcomeoutlineperformancepolicyprefacepreliminarypresentationprocedureprogramprojectprojectionsprospectusrecommenda-representationresearchtionresultsreviewstatementstrategystudysubjectsuggestsummarysystemtechnicaltermstextundertakingventurePHRASESa considerable/significant/import-address the problem ofant advantagealong these linesas you can see from the databallpark figureclose/exhaustive inquirycopy of the proceedingsdetailed statementeducated guessestimated valuegive our position ongives me to understandin-depth account of/look atinstitute inquiriesmake inquiry/known/publicmap outmatter at hand/in dispute/underplanning stagesdiscussion/at issueplan of actionposition paperrough computation/calcula-subject of inquirytion/draft/guesssummarizes the progress ofsupplies/offers/provides some dis-tinct advantagestake into considerationtake measures/stepsunder consideration/discussion318 / HOW TO SAY IT®SENTENCESData on in-line skating injuries in the United States during the past two years are charted below.I propose that we set up a subcommittee to study flex-hours for all salaried employees.Our annual report on homelessness in the six-county metro area reveals both good news and bad news.Re: Acquisition of the Cypress Spa Products Corp.Sperrit-Midmore Landscape Supply Center has had one of its most successful quarters ever—see below for details.Subject: Proposed staffing changes in conference catering.The following report was prepared by Robert Famish and Narcissa Topehall.This report summarizes your benefits and any optional coverage you have chosen as of January 1.PARAGRAPHSA citizen task force composed of interested persons was formed last May and met almost the entire year to make recommendations to the Planning Commission, which, in turn, made its report to the City Council. Their report is summarized here.Since our letter of September 3, in which we compared electroplating and sputtering for production of thin alloy films for recording, we have done some additional research on this subject. We have found that as long as the proper microstructure is achieved, both electroplating and sputtering are effective. It appears too early to exclude either of the processes. It may be helpful, however, to do a rough cost analysis either as more data from research in these two areas become available or by making a number of assumptions.I’ve checked into the matter of buying versus renting an air compressor, and it seems far more cost-effective in the long run and convenient for us in the short run to buy a small portable air compressor rather than to rent one as needed. A study of our use of an air compressor suggests that although we need one only “infrequently,” the rental charges and lost productive time in not having one immediately available outweight the cost of a new one. I suggest buying.SAMPLE LETTERSDear Etta,Re: Proposed Budget for Design of Streets DRS–821.01We have estimated the design cost to produce final plans for the relo-HOW TO SAY IT® / 319cation of Concannon Street from the bypass to the railroad tracks, and for Concannon Bypass from Blake Avenue to Nicholas. The design of Concannon Street is for a length of approximately 2,000 feet and consists of five traffic lanes, curb and gutter, and a raised median over 25% of its length. The Concannon Bypass design covers approximately 2,500 feet and includes curb and gutter along the outside lanes and median, pavement widening, intersection improvements, acceleration and decel-eration lanes, and signals at three locations. The cost works out to $55,000, and we therefore propose that a budget for this amount be approved.Please call me if you have any questions concerning our estimate.Thanks.Sincerely,To: Marketing DepartmentFrom: Stephen RolloDate: March 4, 2002Re: Report on recent drop in salesThis memo report will serve as a summary of the attached 12-page in-depth report on what appear to be the mechanisms and underlying causes of the recent nationwide drop in sales at our restaurant equipment and supply outlets.Based on these ideas, I’m planning experimental modifications to our outlets in Colorado Springs and Denver. If you have opinions on these ideas (especially if you disagree), I’d appreciate hearing from you.The driving forces for sales to restaurants are of course need, immediate availability, accessibility, and price. We have isolated price as the critical factor in the recent downturn. Although our prices are, in fact, competitive with other suppliers, our prices do notappearto be competitive.The report details the three potential ways of dealing with the perception that we are more expensive than our competitors. Please reflect, both individually and in groups, on our choices.I will let you know the results of the planned changes in Del Mar and San Diego. In the meantime, I would appreciate getting as much feedback as possible (and as quickly as possible) on the attached report.ProposalMarryat Insulation Systems, Inc.320 / HOW TO SAY IT®54 Easthupp BoulevardFrederick, IA 50501Proposed work:• Install fiberglass under boards in 900 sq. ft. attic area of two-story house.• Remove and replace necessary boards.• Install wind tunnels.• Install 2 R-61 roof vents.• Install fiberglass in sidewalls, approx. 2000 sq. ft.• Drill siding and redwood plug, chisel and putty, owner to sand and paint.• Remove and replace siding, drill above second floor windows only.• Install 4 8” x 16” soffit vents, 2 front, 2 rear.We propose hereby to furnish material and labor—complete in accordance with above specifications—for the sum of cash on completion, $2307.All material is guaranteed to be as specified.
